= Readme for Ramaze

Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework.
The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to
make simple things simple and complex things possible.

This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often
forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to
give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve
perfect custom-tailored results.

Another interesting aspect is that Ramaze tries to provide as much reusable
code as possible, as to encourage the use of its code in similar projects and
to act as a single point of reference for projects using its components.
This tries to tackle the problem that everybody who wants/needs to create a
custom web framework always has to reimplement the most basic and common
functionality.

So when for example someone wants a basic example of how to build a comfortable
testing environment for a web framework it's hardly leading to the goal if this
first has to be reinvented before even the basic testing can start.

The same goes for the implementation of sessions or the request/response
objects which are collected under the module Trinity. Or all the examples
of real world-usage of the most popular templating-engines. Within a framework,
not to mention the basic need for a Dispatcher.

Of course most other frameworks will introduce their own paradigms and special
implementations, and this is the reason why it is not encouraged to directly
require files from Ramaze, they are one working entity together, but with a few
modifications it's your very own implementation and fits into your own project.
Not to mention that introducing another web framework for your own would be
quite odd ;)


== Basic Principles of Ramaze

There are some basic principles that Ramaze tries to follow:

* Test everything

  What use is a wonderful application if it doesn't work?


* Document everything

  Documentation is the glue between the code and the programmers brain


* Keep It Super Simple (KISS)

  Most things should be understandable after reading them once


* Principle Of Least Surprise (POLS)

  Going the way of ruby


* Modular design

  Making it as simple as possible to extract parts


* Minimal dependencies

  In case a dependency is not met use a simple fall-back instead


* Provide as many examples as possible

  Examples are a superior way of getting a quick start into everything


* Open development

  I happily accept all patches or feature-requests that you may have,
  as long as they comply with these principles


== Quick features overview

Ramaze offers following features at the moment:

* Adapters
  * Mongrel
    http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/
    Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for
    hosting Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than
    FastCGI or SCGI.

  * WEBrick
    http://www.webrick.org/
    WEBrick is a Ruby library program to build HTTP servers.


* Templates
  * Amrita2

    http://amrita2.rubyforge.org/
    Amrita2 is a xml/xhtml template library for Ruby. It makes html documents
    from a template and a model data.

  * Erubis

    http://rubyforge.org/projects/erubis
    Erubis is a fast, secure, and very extensible implementation of eRuby.

  * Haml

    http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/
    Haml takes your gross, ugly templates and replaces them with veritable Haiku.

  * Liquid

    http://home.leetsoft.com/liquid
    Liquid's syntax and parse model are inspired by Django templates, as well
    as PHP's smarty.

  * Markaby

    http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/markaby/
    Markaby means Markup as Ruby.

  * Ezamar

    A simple homage to Nitros templating. Please check out http://nitroproject.org
    for more information.

* Cache
  * Hash
  * YAML::Store
  * MemCache

* Helper
  * Aspect
  * Auth
  * Cache
  * Feed
  * Form
  * Link
  * Redirect
  * Stack

* Various
  * Sessions
  * Global configuration system
  * Simple request/response handling
  * Custom Error-handling


== Getting started

Now that you have a vague idea of what you're about to get into you might just
want to get a way to get up and running ASAP.
Please read below for more information about installation.

Depending on what you are planning to do you can either just go and start
reading the source or directly get some hands-on experience by trying some of
the examples.
Most things will require dependencies though. The basic functionality is
provided by the WEBrick adapter and the Template::Ramaze, which just run out
of the box. For more features you will have to install some templating-engines
and mongrel (_very_ recommended). Ramaze will inform you when it needs further
dependencies, so just go and try some things.

Some places to get started are:
- Read the documentation.
- Run and read the test cases.
- Look at the examples and run/modify them.


== Installing Ramaze

* via RubyGems

  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via 

    $ gem install ramaze

  in case you have RubyGems installed.
  (this will work as soon as I have registered on RubyForge ;)

* via install.rb

  Ramaze provides a basic install.rb that should take care of the installation
  you can use it like 

    $ ruby install.rb

  you may need root-privileges to do
  that, depending on what options you provide.
  (please note that I haven't tested the install.rb extensively yet, so if you
  find some quirks, please send me patches or a simple note)

* via darcs

  To get the latest and sweetest, you can just pull from the repository and run
  Ramaze that way.

    $ darcs get http://manveru.mine.nu/ramaze

  Please read the man page or `darcs help` for more information about updating
  and creating your own patches.
  This is at the moment the premier way to use Ramaze, since it is the way I use
  it.


== Ramaze Examples

There are some examples for your instant pleasure inside the examples-directory
in the Ramaze-distribution.
To start up an example, you can use the Ramaze binary located in bin/ramaze 
for example:

  $ ramaze examples/hello.rb

Or:

  $ cd examples/blog
  $ ramaze

Since ramaze uses the main.rb by default if you don't pass anything else.

For more information about the usage of ramaze try:

  $ ramaze --help


Examples include:

* examples/hello.rb
  Hello, World!

* examples/simple.rb
  A bit more advanced than the hello-example, but still very basic.

* examples/blog
  Not yet fully functional, but coming along.

* examples/whywiki
  A basic examples of a minimalistic application, based on the Wiki of _why in
  his camping-framework.

* examples/templates
  examples of real usage of the templating-engines. Tries to implement the same
  functionality in each template_*.rb file using a different engine.


== good to know

* Nicer Error-pages
  * Install coderay (it's a gem)

* Performance
  * Serving
  
    For best performance you should consider using Mongrel to host your
    application.

  * Caching
  
    You can easily cache your pages using the CacheHelper.
    Also, using MemCache gives you high-end performance and security.
