README for Ramaze
=================

Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework.
The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible.

This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features.
Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achive perfect custom-tailored results.

At the moment Ramaze offers following features:

- Adapters
-- Mongrel

- Templates
-- Ramaze
-- Amrita2

- Various
-- Sessions

-- simple request/response handling

-- wide configurability via the Global system
   You can just add your own options via Global.your_option = :foo
   The defaults and possible values:
      Global.adapter    ||= :mongrel  # uses the class from Adapter::
      Global.host       ||= '0.0.0.0' # restrict access to a specific host
      Global.port       ||= 7000      # adapter runs on that port
      Global.mode       ||= :debug    # :debug|:stage|:live - atm only difference in verbosity
      Global.run_loose  ||= false     # detaches Ramaze to run in the background (used for testcases)
      Global.cache      ||= false     # caches requests to the controller based on request-values
      Global.tidy       ||= false     # run tidy over the generated html if Content-Type is text/html
      Global.error_page ||= true      # display an error-page with backtrace on errors

Good to know
