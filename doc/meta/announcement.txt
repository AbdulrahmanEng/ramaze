This time we are proud to announce Version 0.1.3 of the Ramaze framework, a
light and modular open source web framework.

Since the last release some polishing and improvments have been made, it seems
like Ramaze is now mostly feature-complete.

An extensive set of specs is covering almost every detail of the implementation
and usage. It is developed by several people and already in production-use at
some companies.

A complete Changelog is available at http://manveru.mine.nu/ramaze/doc/CHANGELOG


Known issues:

  - Haml: either use Haml version 1.5.2 or require ActionPack.


Features:
  - Builds on top of the recently released Rack library, which provides easy use
    of adapters like Mongrel, WEBrick, CGI or FCGI.

  - Supports a wide range of templating-engines like:
      Amrita2, Erubis, Haml, Liquid, Markaby, Remarkably and its own engine
      called Ezamar.

  - Highly modular structure, you can just use the parts you like. This also
      means that it's very simple to add your own customizations.

  - A variety of helpers is already available, giving you things like advanced
      caching, OpenID-authentication or aspect-oriented programming for your
      controllers.

  - It is possible to use the ORM you like, be it ActiveRecord, Og, Kansas or
      something more simplistic like a wrapper around YAML::Store.

  - Good documentation: although we don't have 100% (dcov says around 75%)
      documentation right now, just about every part of Ramaze is covered with
      basic and advanced docs.
      There are a variety of examples and a tutorial available.

  - Friendly community: lastly, but still quite important, there are people from
      all over the world using Ramaze, so you can get almost instant help and
      info.
