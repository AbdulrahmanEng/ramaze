This time we are proud to announce Version 0.1.2 of the Ramaze framework, an
open source web framework with the aim to be light and modular.

Since the 0.1.0 release we have made a lot of progress and the overall API has
mostly settled down. An extensive set of tests is covering almost every detail
of the implementation and usage.

It is developed by by several people and already in production-use at some
companies.

New Features in Version 0.1.2: ( review and remove unimportant stuff )

 - Restructuring of Ramaze internals, featuring a cleaner overall layout.

 - Add Ramaze::Record to easily record requests fitting particular patterns.

 - Support for the Remarkably templating engine.

 - Adapted for Rack 0.2

 - Easier caching.

 - replacing autoreload with the almighty SourceReload.

 - tiny DSL for settings.

 - Global is now a Struct, no OpenStruct.

 - Default logger is now LogHub with Inform

 - Lightweight error-page.

 - Central API for caches.

 - Reviewed and largely improved tutorial and examples.

 - Even less patches to the Ruby core, mostly for compatibility with the
   upcoming Ruby 1.9 and tested with older versions down to 1.8.2.

 - Largely improved Spec-framework for any kind of web-application.

 - Through some benchmarking and refactoring the overall speed has improved
   around the factor 2.

A complete Changelog is available at [ insert URL ]


Features:
  - Builds on top of the recently released Rack library, which provides easy use
    of adapters like Mongrel, WEBrick, CGI or FCGI.

  - Supports a wide range of templating-engines like:
      Amrita2, Erubis, HAML, Liquid, Markaby, Remarkably and its own engine
      called Ezamar.

  - Highly modular structure, you can just use the parts you like. This also
      means that it's very simple to add your own customizations.

  - A variety of helpers is already available, giving you things like advanced
      caching, OpenID-authentication or aspect-oriented programming for your
      controllers.

  - It is possible to use the ORM you like, be it ActiveRecord, Og, Kansas or
      something more simplistic like a wrapper around YAML::Store.

  - Good documentation: although we don't have 100% documentation right now,
      just about every part of Ramaze is covered with basic and advanced docs.
      There are a variety of examples and a tutorial available.

  - Friendly community: lastly, but still quite important, there are people from
      all over the world using Ramaze, so you can get almost instant help and
      info.


Features planned:
  - Unified FormHelper for ORMs, making the framework mostly independent of the
      underlying model.

  - Support for distributed deployment over DRb.
