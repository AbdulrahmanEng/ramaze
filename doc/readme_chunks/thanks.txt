There is a large number of people who made Ramaze possibe by their ongoing
efforts in the world of open source and by encouraging and helping me.

This list is by no means a full coverage of all these people, but I try to
get a good coverage despite that.

I would like to thank:

* Yukihiro Matsumoto a.k.a matz

    For giving the world Ruby and bringing fun back into programming.

* Zed Shawn a.k.a. zedas

    For developing Mongrel, Ramaze started out as a simple Hello World based
    on that awesome server.

* Christian Neukirchen a.k.a chris2

    For building rack, which is just what the numerous web-developers had
    anticipated and which will, with no doubt, change the world.

* Pistos

    For continious encouragment and building the first real webpage on Ramaze.
    His bugreports were invaluable.

* Thomas Sawyer a.k.a Trans

    Dragging me deep into the rabbit-hole and showing me how awesome Ruby
    truely is.

    Also for working on facets and ratchets.
