There are some basic principles that Ramaze tries to follow:

* Test everything

  What use is a wonderful application if it doesn't work?


* Document everything

  Documentation is the glue between the code and the programmers brain


* Keep It Super Simple (KISS)

  Most things should be understandable after reading them once


* Principle Of Least Surprise (POLS)

  Going the way of ruby


* Modular design

  Making it as simple as possible to extract parts


* Minimal dependencies

  In case a dependency is not met use a simple fall-back instead


* Provide as many examples as possible

  Examples are a superior way of getting a quick start into everything


* Open development

  I happily accept all patches or feature-requests that you may have,
  as long as they comply with these principles
