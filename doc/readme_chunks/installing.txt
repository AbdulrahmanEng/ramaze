* via RubyGems

  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via 

    $ gem install ramaze

  in case you have RubyGems installed.


* via git

  To get the latest and sweetest, you can just pull from the repository and run
  Ramaze that way.

    $ git clone git://gitweb.com/manveru/ramaze

  Please read the man page or `git help` for more information about updating
  and creating your own patches.
  This is at the moment the premier way to use Ramaze, since it is the way I use
  it.

  Some hints for the usage of Git.

  * use require 'ramaze' from everywhere

    add a file to your site\_ruby named 'ramaze.rb'
    the content should be: "require '/path/to/git/repo/ramaze/lib/ramaze'"

  * get the latest version (from inside the ramaze directory)

    $ git pull

  * Reset the repo to original state (if you screw up something)

    $ git reset --hard # resets the whole repo
    $ git checkout master lib/ramaze.rb # revert changes to lib/ramaze.rb only

  * record a patch for all your changes

    $ git commit -a # commit all changes

  * record a patch for specific changes

    $ git add -p # pick the hunks you want to commit
    $ git commit

  * output your patches into a bundle ready to be mailed (compress it before
    sending to make sure it arrives in the way you sent it)

    $ git pull # make sure you are on latest revision to avoid conflicts
    $ git format-patch origin/HEAD # spit out 00xx-blah.patch files

    # From here on you can use either git-send-email or go the manual route
    $ tar -cjf ramaze\_bundle.tar.bz2 \*.patch
    # add this bz2 as attachment and send to ramaze@googlegroups.com
