  # The purpose of this class is to provide an easy way of setting/retrieving
  # from the current flash.
  #
  # Flash is a way to keep a temporary pairs of keys and values for the duration
  # of two requests, the current and following.
  #
  # Very vague Example:
  #
  # On the first request, for example on registering:
  #
  #   flash[:error] = "You should reconsider your username, it's taken already"
  #   redirect R(self, :register)
  #
  # This is the request from the redirect:
  #
  #   do_stuff if flash[:error]
  #
  # On the request after this, flash[:error] is gone.
