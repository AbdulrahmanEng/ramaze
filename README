README for ramaze
=================

Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework.
The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible.

This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features.
Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achive perfect custom-tailored results.
