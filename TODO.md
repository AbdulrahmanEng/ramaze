## Specifications

There are quite a few specifications that are still failing, examples of these
specs are the HTTP Digest, the Ramaze command, file dispatches and a few others.

## Documentation

It would be nice if Ramaze would be just as well documented as Innate.
Currently YARD indicates that about 50% is documented, let's see if we can get that to somewhere around 80% - 90%.

## Examples

Perhaps the examples could use a little update, some of the code is quite old (although might still work).

## Rake tasks

There are a few Rake tasks that are somewhat redundant such as rake release:github. Perhaps these should be removed.
